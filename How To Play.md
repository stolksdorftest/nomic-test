# what is nomic

Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.

# how to play

All you need is a github account. All rules will always be recorded in the [README.md] and all scores will be recorded in the [Scoreboard.md].

2. Find the open pull request (there should usually only be one)
3. Write your comment or vote. For voting, start your comment with "AGREED" or "DECLINE", followed by X/Y, which stands for how many people are in favour / how many people have voted. This gives us a easily check-able state of voting at a glance. ![](http://i.imgur.com/F1j6NF0.jpg)

### what about randomness?

Some parts of the game may require randomness. We will be using a random number site that let's us set seeds. We will use the url of the pull request in question to generate the random number.

for example : [https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=6&col=5&base=10&format=plain&rnd=id.https://github.com/stolksdorf/nomos-test/pull/1](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&min=1&max=6&col=5&base=10&format=plain&rnd=id.https://github.com/stolksdorf/nomos-test/pull/1) will get a random number between 1 and 6, using Jared's first pull request as a seed. Therefore it will always be 6.
