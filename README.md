# Nomic-test
This is a test Round for Nomic

## Rules

1. One turn consists of two parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and (2) throwing one d6 once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score.
2. A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. If this rule is not amended by the end of the second complete circuit of turns, it automatically changes to require only a simple majority. 
3. An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment that it is merged into this repo.
4. Each player always has exactly one vote.
5. If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.
6. The game follows the following turn order:

 * Jared
 * Scott
 * Kellen

7. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
8. This game ends on September 1st 2015, midnight. The player with the highest point value at this time wins the game.
